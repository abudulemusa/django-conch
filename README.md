# django-conch

Run an SSH server which provides direct access to the Django shell for
superusers.


## Installation

    pip install django_conch

Then just add `'django_conch'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting. Done.


## Usage

    django-admin.py conch -p 1234

This runs the SSH server on port 1234â€”it's best to execute this under your
daemonization tool of choice.

Run this to access the shell. All the models in your project will be imported
into the top-level namespace for you.
